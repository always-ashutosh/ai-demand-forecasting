# 🍽️ Food Demand Forecasting using Time-Series Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Overview

This project builds an **end-to-end time-series forecasting system** to predict daily food demand for a restaurant using historical sales data.

The goal is to enable:

* 📦 Better inventory planning
* ♻️ Reduction of food waste
* 📊 Data-driven business decisions

The project follows a **complete machine learning pipeline**, from data analysis to deployment via an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

* ✅ End-to-end ML pipeline (EDA → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Deployment)
* 📈 Time-series forecasting using lag & rolling features
* 🤖 Advanced models: Random Forest & XGBoost
* ⏳ Time-aware cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit)
* 🖥️ Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for predictions
* 💼 Business-focused insights for real-world impact

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Forecast daily food demand using historical data
* Capture trend, seasonality, and temporal dependencies
* Compare baseline and advanced ML models
* Reduce overstocking and stockouts
* Enable data-driven decision making

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** Simulated restaurant POS dataset (Balaji Fast Food Sales)

### Features:

* Date and time of transaction
* Item name and category
* Quantity sold (**target variable**)
* Item price and transaction amount
* Transaction type and time of sale

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Raw sales data is aggregated into daily demand
2. Time-based and lag features are created
3. Data is split sequentially to prevent leakage
4. Models are trained using historical patterns
5. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using TimeSeriesSplit
6. Best model (XGBoost) is selected
7. Predictions and insights are served via a Streamlit dashboard
